AI Farmer Assistant Chatbot
A single-file, highly responsive web application designed to provide immediate, knowledgeable assistance to farmers and agricultural enthusiasts. It acts as an AI assistant, utilizing Google's Gemini API for multimodal interaction (text, voice, and image analysis) and grounded advice.

Real-Time Grounding: Uses Google Search grounding to provide the most current information on market prices, weather impacts, and treatment recommendations.

Voice Output (TTS): The AI's responses can be read aloud using the Gemini Text-to-Speech API.

Voice Input (STT): Use the microphone button to dictate your query, enabling hands-free operation in the field.

Responsive Design: Optimized using Tailwind CSS for excellent usability on both mobile devices and desktop screens.
